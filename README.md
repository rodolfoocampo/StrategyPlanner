## Healthy Country AI Strategy Planner: an AI-enabled decision support system for prioritising invasive weed actions on Indigenous lands

*This is the early prototype for a Python module developed by Rodolfo Ocampo as part of his master's final project at the 3A Institute (3Ai). The 3Ai is a new institute at the Australian National University that is building a new branch of engineering —cybernetic engineering— that studies the safe, sustainable and responsible development of artificial intelligence enabled cyber-physical systems. This project was undertaken at the host organisation CSIRO, within their Healthy Country AI project.*

## **Overview**

The Healthy Country AI project in Kakadu National Park is a collaboration between Bininj co-researchers and Indigenous rangers, the Kakadu Board of Management, CSIRO, Parks Australia, Northern Australia National Environment Science Program (NESP), the University of Western Australia (UWA), Charles Darwin University (CDU) and Microsoft to integrate responsible AI in conservation efforts on indigenous land.

Healthy Country AI is currently being used to tackle an invasive grass that threatens Kakadu's biodiversity and Bininj culture, since it is overtaking the habitat of environmentally and culturally relevant native species. Drones are used to collect aerial photos, which are then classified by machine learning algorithms. Infestation maps and data analysis are presented in a dashboard used by rangers to support grass management activities.

The technology has been developed with guidance from Traditional Owners. For example, training data for the machine learning model is labeled according to the Bininj seasons. A novel data governance structure has guaranteed Traditional Owners maintain exclusive access to particular levels of data (Healthy Country AI, 2019).  

As we can see, the Healthy Country AI is a cyber-physical system with human, robotic, digital and environmental components that interact through a feedback loop.

## **The need**


My master's project involved working on a need identified by the Healthy Country AI team: turning data into action more effectively, by using the data and simulation algorithms to model optimal management strategies.

In particular, my work involves developing a new component in the loop that is able analyse the information collected, run it through a simulation algorithm, and help rangers find optimal strategies. This repository contains the the first prototype of Python module that can be integrated in the Healthy Country AI system.

In the context of cybernetic engineering, contributing to a cyber-physical system comes with the question of how to do it safely, sustainably and responsibly? My approach is to leverage systematic conservation planning, an established framework, as a bridge between cybernetic engineering, and the problem at hand.

This documentation contains the progress so far, corresponding to an initial prototype. Further development will be carried out in a second capstone.
