## Requirements

The requirements for the development of this tool were defined collaborativelly with the available project stakeholders: the project leads Justin Perry and Cathy Robinson. For reasons outside of my control, I did not have the possibility to gather requirements directly from users.

### Identification and definition of requirements. 
These requirements were gathered through calls and email communications in a continuous process described below. 

The first stage involved eliciting feedback from the conversation from the presentation of the first capstone.

After the presentation, I summarised the feedback from the presentation from the first capstone, sent it to participants for validation, who agreed on it.

The feedback from that initial presentation centered on the following points:

- The opportunity to implement spread model. In particular, do an implementation Adams et al (2015) in Python since that has been a common request for the authors. 
- Include user interactivity in map
- Consider how this tool can scale to other situations and systems. 
- Begin work on a paper. 

After this I had another call where we discussed this feedback identified the most important areas of focus. 

- The first was having a paper manuscript. 
- The second one was including a spread model and interactivity on the dashboard to be able to see different strategies.

With this, the first weeks on the capstone were spent doing a literature review and writing an introduction for the paper that would lay the basis for its further development. 

After those first weeks,and concurrently to work on the paper, I worked on expanding the code, going from a limited initial functionality and dashboard shown in Figure 1, to expanded functionality with spread modelling and more interactive and functional dashboard shown in Figure 2.

This development was constantly revised and I received feedback from Cathy on a weekly basis as we set up a weekly catch up call. 

A final interview was conducted after the presentation of this stage and it was accepted by Cathy and Justin to validate achievement of objectives with a succesful outcomes. 

Additionally, we also had a call with Steve Steve Van Bodegraven from Microsoft and I will begin with him the process to merge it into Healthy Country AI. He also invited me to present the project in a Microsoft AI for Earth event.
